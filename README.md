The above codes are used to run the OFormer model for predicting CO2 gas saturation and pressure build-up. The dataset utilized in these predictions is sourced from https://github.com/gegewen/ufno/tree/main. Download attention.py, encoder_module.py, decoder_module.py, and loss.py. Then run on either OFormer train gas saturation.py or OFormer train pressure.py. Parameters can be changed in these two files for optimization.
